> Explore, model, and understand analogical reasoning in cognition, language, and computational models from an interdisciplinary perspective


**Analogy-Angle II** is a multidisciplinary workshop to advance research on analogical abstraction by bridging the fields of computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology. This workshop seeks to foster collaboration among researchers by providing a platform for sharing novel insights, benchmarks, methodologies, and analogy applications across disciplines. **Analogy-Angle II** welcomes diverse contributions, including original research, reviews, and previously accepted papers from leading conferences.
[Analogy-Angle I](https://analogy-angle.github.io/2024) was co-located with IJCAI 2024.

## Background

Analogical abstraction is a fundamental cognitive skill unique to humans (Penn et al., 2008; Hofstadter, 2001), defined as the ability to perceive and utilize the similarities between concepts, situations or events based on (systems of) relations rather than surface similarities (Holyoak, 2012; Gentner et al., 2012). Analogy enables creative inferences, explanations, and generalization of knowledge, and has been used for scientific inventions (Dunbar and Klahr, 2012), solving problems (Gick and Holyoak, 1980), and policy-making (Houghton, 1998). As such, it has been the goal of one of the first AI programs developed by Evans (1964). It has also been the subject of cognitive theories and studies about humans for common processes, such as the retrieval of memories (Wharton et al., 1994) and problem-solving (Gick and Holyoak, 1980), mostly leveraging narratives as their experimental medium (Gentner and Toupin, 1986; Gentner et al., 1993; Wharton et al., 1994), given their multi-tiered nature and potential for abstraction. 

Meanwhile, analogical tasks have also been a relatively popular topic in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), typically framed as intelligence tests for models compared against humans. So-called word-based, proportional analogies of the form (A : B :: C : D) (Mikolov et al., 2013a,b; Gladkova et al., 2016; Ushio et al., 2021) are often used to measure the potential of word embeddings and language models. Recent studies (Webb et al., 2023) show a strong ability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs) to discover proportional word analogies, though this skill degrades with higher complexity (Wijesiriwardene et al., 2023) or when controlling for association-based answers (Stevenson et al., 2023). Shifting toward more complex settings, narrative-based analogy benchmarks that involve system mappings rather than simple word-based relational mappings have been also been considered recently, with limitations in scope, generalizability, and alignment with cognitive theories (Nagarajah et al., 2022; Wijesiriwardene et al., 2023; Sourati et al., 2023). Meanwhile, given the potential of large language and visual models, another line of research aims to study their ability to draw analogies consistently (cf., Webb et al., 2023). Given the richness of analogical abstraction and the wide interest in this topic from artificial intelligence, linguistics, and cognitive psychology, it is important to connect these communities and facilitate cross-disciplinary activities.

**Prior events:** [The first iteration of Analogy-Angle](https://analogy-angle.github.io/2024) was co-located with IJCAI 2024 in Jeju, South Korea. The workshop received 11 submissions in total (6 novel and 5 dissemination papers). 7 of these papers were accepted, consisting of 3 novel and 4 dissemination papers. The dissemination papers were published within a year prior to the workshop in ACL, TACL, EMNLP, and NAACL. Besides papers, the workshop included two keynote talks by Ken Forbus and Tony Veale and a panel that included the keynote speakers and the paper presenters. The workshop participation was in-person only. It had a steady amount of 30 active participants, and featured many discussions during the talks and over the social activities. The organizing committee of the first iteration of the workshop consisted of 20\% men and 80\% women.
